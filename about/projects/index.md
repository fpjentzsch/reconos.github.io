# Projects

## CRC 901 - On-The-Fly Computing

The objective of this DFG-funded Collaborative Research Centre is to develop techniques and processes for automatic on-the-fly configuration and provision of individual IT services. One area of this project deals with Proof-Carrying Hardware as an innovative concept to ensure quality of third party IP. In this context, ReconOS is used as a platform for multiple demonstrators and has been successfully integrated with other novel reconfigurable hardware technologies, such as virtual FPGA overlays.

## Epics - Self-adaptive and Self-aware Computing Systems

Another line of research also leverages the unified software/hardware interface and partial reconfiguration to create self-adaptive and self-aware computing systems that autonomously optimize performance goals under varying workloads. In the EPiCS project funded by the European Commission, researchers of the University of Paderborn advanced the autonomy of computing systems and enabled them to optimize for diverse goals such as performance, energy consumption, and chip temperature based on the current quality-of-service requirements, workload characteristics and system state.

## Adaptive Network Architectures

Researchers at ETH Zurich use ReconOS to implement adaptive network architectures that continuously optimize the network protocol stack on a per-application basis to cope with varying transmission characteristics, security requirements, and compute resources availability. The developed architecture autonomously adapts itself by offloading performance-critical, network processing tasks to hardware threads, which are loaded at runtime using dynamic partial reconfiguration.


# Publications

ReconOS has been developed in the context of several academic research projects since 2006. Below you find a comprehensive list of publications that describe selected aspects of ReconOS.
